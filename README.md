# Neural Crest Timecourse Analysis
A collaboration between Austin and Debbie

This repository is broken down into 3 sections
1. RNA-Seq Data Processing and Analysis (./RNA-Seq)
2. CUT&RUN Data Processing and Analysis (./CUT-RUN)
3. ATAC-Seq Data Processing and Analysis (./ATAC-Seq)

For analysis combining these datasets, we will have to create a new folder down the line.

The first time you want to work on an aspect of this repository, after cloning the repo, make your own branch. This should allow us to work independently on the same documents without having conflicting merges.
